# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Invasion.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Will be a game similar to Space Invaders where you will have to shoot down alien ships. It will be a 2d game.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

In our game, we will have a spaceship that can only move left and right to try to take down alien ships and also avoid getting hit by the aliens who are attacking you. If the alien ship gets hit, it will be destroyed and you will get a score of 100 but if the player's spaceship gets hit, they will lose a live and they will only have a total of 3 lives. The main goal of the game is to get the highest score as possible.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.



## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
