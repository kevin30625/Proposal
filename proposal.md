# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The Invasion.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Will be a game similar to Space Invaders where you will have to shoot down alien ships. It will be a 2d game.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

In our game, we will have a spaceship that can only move left and right to try to take down alien ships and also try to avoid getting hit by the alien ships who are also attacking you. If the alien ship gets hit, it will be destroyed and it will increase your score by 100 but if the player's spaceship gets hit, they will lose a live and they will only have a total of 3 lives. The main goal of the game is to get the highest score as possible.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not planning to combine with another course.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Name: Meraj Din,
Email: tup10551@temple.edu,
TA: Elmira Talebianaraki

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for this project would be for the game to work properly.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for this project would be finishing the basic code of the game before the deadline and having enough time to make the spectacles better.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for this project would be having a fully functionl game with no bugs and also have it be visually appealing.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The next steps for us are to do some research about the game Space Invaders and use it as inspiration to create a similar game. We will need to acquire new skills on how to build a game since this is new for both of us. We will work together step by step in order to create a fully operational game.
